# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System
Developed a content-based movie recommender using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. Used TF-IDF to vectorize movie descriptions and calculated cosine similarity to suggest the top 5 movies similar to a userâ€™s input. This system helps personalize user experience without relying on user ratings or history.
